\section{Pressure Test of Vessel with Top Plate}
\label{sec:pressure_test}

It is required to peform a pressure test of the assembled vessel and top plate 
at 110\% of the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP).
As stated in Sec.~\ref{sec:system}, the Cryofab vessel (dewar) has a maximum 
allowable working pressure (MAWP) of 10~psig (24.7~psid). 
Calculations in App.~\ref{app:dewar_pressure_ana} show that it is acceptable 
to use with a pressure up to 46.08~psid using allowable stress of 20,000~psi per ASME BPVC.
Also as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:system}, the top plate of the dewar was custom designed 
by SLAC with the thickness of 0.5~inches.
Calculations in App.~\ref{app:top_plate} indicate that the top plate will withstand pressures 
up to 51.44~psig.\\

\textbf{Test pressure calculation}: \\

10~psig + 14.7 = 24.7~psid (pressure differential between inner vessel and outer vacuum jacket) \\
24.7~psid $\times$ 110\% = 27.2~psid \\
27.2~psid - 14.7 = \textit{12.5~psig REQUIRED TEST PRESSURE} \\

The Pressure Test Plan has been prepared and is included as a separate pdf file in this package.
