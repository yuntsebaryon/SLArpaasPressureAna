\section{Burst Disc Discharge Flowrate at Different Scenarios}
\label{sec:discharge_rate}

The discharge capacity of the pressure relief device on SLArPAAS I,
MDC precision burst disc 420033, is rated to be 435~scfm,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mdc_burst_disc} in App.~\ref{app:manufacturer}.
It corresponds to 390.9~scfm in Ar, as calculated in App.~\ref{app:discharge}.\\

We consider a few failure scenarios and calculate the Ar flow rate,
as summarized in Table~\ref{table:discharge_summary},
confirming that the discharge capacity of the burst disc meets the
system requirement.
These numbers are overestimated, as described in App.~\ref{app:discharge},
and can be considered as the upper bounds.
More calculation details can be found in App.~\ref{app:discharge}.
