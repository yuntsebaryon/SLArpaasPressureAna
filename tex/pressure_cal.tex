\section{Pressure Ratings and Calculations}
\label{sec:pressure_cal}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The SLArPAAS I main dewar is normally filled with liquid argon at 
    1--3~psig (15.7--17.7~psia).
    The vendor states that it has a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) 
    of 10~psig (24.7~psid). 
    Calculations show that it is acceptable to use with a pressure up to
    46.08~psid using an allowable stress of 20,000~psi per ASME BPVC. 
    See App.~\ref{app:dewar_pressure_ana}. 
    Note: ``psid'' refers to differential pressure of the inner vessel compared 
    to the jacket of the main dewar.
    \item Calculations per ASME BVPC show the minimum required thickness of the top
    plate to hold 10~psig is 0.27", while the top plate has the thickness of 0.5".
    With the thickness of 0.5", the blind top plate can withstand a pressure of 51.44~psig.
    See App.~\ref{app:top_plate}.
    \item The ring flange stress of the SLArPAAS I dewar are calculated by Cryofab
    according to ASME BVPC, and completed and documented by the SLAC scientist, Yun-Tse Tsai,
    in App.~\ref{app:ring_flange}.  The bolt load, spacing, area, flange bolt load, moment,
    and the flange tangential stress of the SLArPAAS I ring flange all satisfy the requirements.
