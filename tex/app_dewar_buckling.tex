\section{Dewar Buckling Analysis}
\label{app:buckling}

The minimum unsupported length beyond which the critical pressure, $P_c$, is independent of $L$
is called the critical length $L_c$ and is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    L_c = 1.14(1-\nu^2)^{1/4}D_0(D_0/t)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
and for $\nu=0.3$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:critical_l}
    L_c = 1.11D_0(D_0/t)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
All the variables are described in Table~\ref{table:buckling}, and, 
the Poisson's ratio, $\nu= 0.3$, together with all the formulas used in the Cryofab analysis,
are taken from \textit{Pressure Vessel Design Handbook}.
The choice of the Poisson's ratio can be found in the wiki,
``Most steels and rigid polymers when used within their design limits (before yield) 
exhibit values of about 0.3, increasing to 0.5 for post-yield deformation which occurs 
largely at constant volume.''

\input{table/buckling}

For cylindrical shells with $L<L_c$,
Cryofab uses the US Experimental Model Basin formula to calculate the critical pressure, $P_c$,
under uniform external pressure,
\begin{equation}
    P_c = \frac{2.42E}{(1-\nu^2)^{3/4}}\left[\frac{(t/D_0)^{2.5}}{(L/D_0)-0.45(t/D_0)^{0.5}}\right].
\end{equation}
With $\nu = 0.3$ and $0.45(t/D_0)^{0.5}$ being negligible, $P_c$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:critical_P}
    P_c = 2.6E(t/D_0)^{2.5}/(L/D_0).
\end{equation}

The results are presented in Table~\ref{table:buckling}.
Collapse occurs when 4.98~psi is applied outside the inner vessel shell; in other words,
when the vacuum jacket fails and has 4.98~psi relative to the pressure in the inner vessel.
