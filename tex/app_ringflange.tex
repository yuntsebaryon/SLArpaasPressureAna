\section{Ring Flange Stress}
\label{app:ring_flange}

SLArpaas has flat face flanges with metal-to-metal contact outside the bolt
circle, and Figure~Y-5.1.3 in non-Mandatory Appendix~Y, Class~3 Flange Assembly
applies.

\subsection{Bolt Load}
\label{app:bolt_load}

SLArpaas has an O-ring, one of the self-energizing types (Table~2.5-1),
and therefore Mandatory Appendix~2 is referred herein.
The minimum required bolt load for the operating conditions,
$W_{m1}$, can be obtained following Eq.~2-5(c)(3)(-a) with $H_p = 0$,

\begin{equation}
    W_{m1} = H + H_p = H = 0.785G^2 P,
\end{equation}

where $G = 15.25$~in, corresponding to the outside diamter of gasket contact
face in option (b) of the definition of $G$,
and $P$ is the internal pressure, 12.5~psig, as listed in 
Table~\ref{table:blind_flange}.
$W_{m1}$ is 2282.2~pound.\\

The minimum required bolt load for gasket seating, $W_{m2}$, according to
2-5(c)(3)(-b), is 0.

\subsection{Bolt Spacing}
\label{app:bolt_spacing}

According to 2-5(d), the maximum bolt space, $B_{s,max}$, can be obtained
by Eq.~2.5(d)(3)

\begin{equation}
    B_{s,max} = 2a + \frac{6t}{m+0.5},
\end{equation}

where $a$ is the nominal bolt diameter, 0.313~in for 5/16"-18 bolts,
and $m$ is the gasket factor, 0 for O-ring (Table~2-5.1).\\

The maximum bolt spacing $B_{s,max}$ therefore should be 3.326~in,
while SLArpaas has the bolt spacing 2.125~in.
The requirement is satisfied.
